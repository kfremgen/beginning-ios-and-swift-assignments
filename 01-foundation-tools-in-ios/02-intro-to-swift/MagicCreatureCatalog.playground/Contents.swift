/*: # Part 1: Creating Structs
 
 Define a Creature struct with the following properties:
 - name (String)
 -  description (String)
 - isGood (Bool)
 - magicPower (Int)
 
 Create at least three different creature structs that conform to the Creature struct (e.g., Unicorn, Dragon, Phoenix).
 Initialize instances of each creature struct with different values for their properties.

/*: # Part 2: Fibonacci Creature Abilities
 
 Write a function called fibonacciAbility that takes in an Int parameter n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
 Add a computed property called ability to the Creature struct that incorporates the fibonacciAbility function and describes the creatureâ€™s special ability based on its magicPower.

 Add a function called interactWith to the Creature struct that takes another Creature instance as a parameter.
 Inside the interactWith function, use a switch statement to check the isGood property of both creatures and perform a different action based on their alignments (good vs. evil).
 Update the describeCreature function to call the interactWith function for each pair of creatures in the creature, and print out the result of their interaction.
