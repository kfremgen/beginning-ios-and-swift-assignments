/*: # Part 1: Creating Structs
 
 Define a Creature struct with the following properties:
 - name (String)
-  description (String)
 - isGood (Bool)
 - magicPower (Int)
 
 Create at least three different creature structs that conform to the Creature struct (e.g., Unicorn, Dragon, Phoenix).
 Initialize instances of each creature struct with different values for their properties.

 Write a function called fibonacciAbility that takes in an Int parameter n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
 Add a computed property called ability to the Creature struct that incorporates the fibonacciAbility function and describes the creatureâ€™s special ability based on its magicPower.
