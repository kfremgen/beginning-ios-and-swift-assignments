### Exercise 1: Create a Book Repo

To get started, your first task is to create a new project. 
To successfully pass this homework, you must complete all of the requirements.

Requirements:
- Create a new repository
- Make sure to assign the repo a license. Since this repo holds public domain works, assign it a “Creative Commons Zero” license.
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt
- Create a readme to briefly describe the project
- Upload your repo to GitHub

### Exercise 2: Make a Commit

Once you have a repo all set, your next task is to add content to the repo. 
Remember to add the three public domain books to the repo, commit your changes, and push your changes to the repo.

Requirements
- Add three books to the repo, putting them in their own directories
- Commit the books to the repo, providing a descriptive commit message
- Push the changes to your remote repo on GitHub

### Exercise 3: Create a Pull Request

When working as a software developer, you’ll often be submitting code for other software developers to review and/or incorporate into an existing codebase. These updates are known as pull requests and they are critical to understand. 
In this assignment, you’ll create your very own pull request.

Requirements
- Create a new branch on your local repo
- Delete one book, and add a new book to the repo. Feel free to use this book
- Commit changes and push changes to GitHub
- Create a new pull request (PR) on GitHub and have it reviewed
